 We've clearly gone mad and have replaced the div, img, and h4 tags with what
 appears to be a mythical `avatar` tag.
 Note we have a property of user, passing a value of user. This will be the user object
 from the ng-repeat
-->
<ul class='User-list'>
  <li ng-repeat='user in users'>
    <avatar user='user' />
  </li>
</ul>
