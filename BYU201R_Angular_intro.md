We will build a contrived user registration that will take
1. new user's name and 
2. a link to a picture they want to use for an avatar

The added users will then display below the form.

This will help us 
1. reinforce experience with Angular's powerful two-way data binding
2. Introduce us to a very powerful concept that Angular makes possible with its `directive` feature. Angular Directives allow us the ability to encapsulate UI style and behavior into reusable components. This is a critical aspect to scalable web applications.

We will begin by implementing the functionality with an Angular template and controller first, then refactor to include an `Avatar` directive.
